<length, backward distance> length = 1 byte value + 3 offset / backward distance = 2 byte value + 1


Read from MSB (Most significant bit (left to right))

ZLIB blocks header format

BFINAL 1 bit
BTYPE 2 bits:
 Non-Compressed blocks format:
  |LEN||NLEN||LEN bytes of data|
 Dynamic Huffman blocks format:
  |2^5 * 5 bit long huffman code|
  0-15 5 bit codes mean that I write values corresponding 
  to their initial value in the codes table
  16 - copy the previous code 3-6 times depending on the 2 bit uint after the 5 bit value 
  aka 3 + (2 bit value) is the amount of copies.
  17 - Repeat a code length of 0 for 3 - 10 times. (3 bits of length)
  18 - Repeat a code length of 0 for 11 - 138 times (7 bits of length)
